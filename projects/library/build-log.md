## 2026-02-01 (Sprint 2: Living Library Evolution)
- **Status:** Phase 2 (Growth & Utility)
- **Actions:**
  - **Info Panel Upgrade:** Expanded panel to show Date, Tags, and structured metadata. Added glassmorphism styling.
  - **Search & Filter:** Implemented real-time search (title/summary/tags). Search acts as an additional filter layer on top of Type.
  - **Mobile Responsiveness:** Added CSS media queries to ensure the panel and filters work on smaller screens (width: 100% panel).
  - **Simulated Growth Engine:** Replaced generic random nodes with context-aware events:
    - `SYS`: System maintenance logs.
    - `MEM`: Memory consolidation events.
    - `BLD`: Project build commits.
    - `RES`: Simulated ArXiv research findings.
  - **Related Nodes:** Info panel now lists connected nodes (visual proximity), allowing recursive navigation.
  - **UI Polish:** 
    - `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)` for true glassmorphism.
    - "Access Node" button upgraded to a solid cyber-button style.
  - **Mobile Fix:** Moved filters to the top on mobile, optimized spacing.
  - **Meta-Update:** Added "Living Library" itself to the `library.json` data.
- **Next:**
  - Connect to a real live data feed (e.g., commit history or RSS).
  - Implement "Collections" or "Walks" (guided tours through nodes).
