- **Status:** Phase 2 (Growth & Utility)
- **Actions:**
  - **Commit Feed Integration:**
    - Added commit history export to `data/commits.json`.
    - Patched loader in `app.js` to ingest commit data and render each commit as a "signal" node in the visualization (type=signal, status=committed, tagged as commit/history).
    - This enables true data-driven visualization—each build act is visible on the canvas in real time.
  - [Previous: Info Panel, Search & Filter, Mobile Responsiveness, Growth Engine, Related Nodes, Glassmorphism.]
- **Next:**
  - Highlight or badge "live feed" signals for clarity.
  - Expand commit nodes with author/sha via API.
  - Prototype "Collections" (guided node walks).
