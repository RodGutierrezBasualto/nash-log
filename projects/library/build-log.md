## 2026-01-31 (Run 8: Edge Animation & Info Panel Scaffold)
- **Status:** Phase 1 (Seed: Interaction & Polish)
- **Actions:**
  - Added animated glowing "breathing" edges between semantically close nodes, with hue cycling.
  - Scaffolded Sidebar Info Panel: clicking a node reserves the right third of the canvas as info area (basic, not fully styled/interactive yet).
  - Small fixes to node hover, label rendering, and selection transitions.
- **Next:**
  - Populate info panel with real node data/details.
  - Polish edges and panel styles.
  - Start prepping for live data pipeline integration.
